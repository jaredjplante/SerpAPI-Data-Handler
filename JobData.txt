More About Thanx:

Thanx is a leading provider of digital guest engagement for offline businesses. Brick-and-mortar retailers, restaurants, and malls are facing an unprecedented crisis in the aftermath of COVID-19; Thanx helps these businesses embrace digital purchasing, capture greater customer data, and take action on that information to personalize every interaction with their guests. Our proprietary integrations with credit card networks (e.g. Visa) provide the volume and accuracy of purchase data which sits at the core of every product we build. Last quarter, Thanx saw record digital purchasing and marketing campaigns initiated on our platform, even amid a global pandemic. Recently named to the Nation’s Restaurant News “2020 Power List” as one of the 50 most influential innovators in food-service, our CEO describes our vision: “Brick-and-mortar commerce in the US alone is a multi-trillion dollar category but most businesses still severely lack the data and tools to deliver personalized, closed-loop marketing. Thanx is on a mission to change this permanently.”

Thanx has gained the investment of prominent venture and growth equity luminaries, having raised more than $30M from elite investors such as M33 Growth, Ribbit Capital, and Sequoia Capital. Core to our success is a culture that has attracted some of the best talents from across the country; we are proud of our incredibly strong employee tenure, track-record of internal promotions, and impressive alumni network. We credit our cultural “core behaviors” with these accomplishments: Find A Way, Focus on What Matters, Say “Thanx” Genuinely, Welcome Diverse Perspectives, and Empathy Over Ego.

• Backend: Ruby on Rails, Golang, gRPC

title : Senior Software Developer (Contract, $110-$190/hr) teaming up for...
company_name : A.Team
location :   United States   
via : via Built In NYC
description : A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only platform for senior software builders to team up with the best companies on their next big thing. After talking with hundreds of independent builders, we get that finding vetted, high-quality clients is hard and tasks are often too small to be rewarding; A·Teams are formed for impactful new products with companies backed by A16Z, GC, Softbank... Apollo, YC, etc. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $7.3+ million since then.

As part of A·Team, you can expect:
• High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. A·Team is picky, and only works with companies referred to us by top funds or existing members and clients such as Lyft, McGraw Hill, the former-CEO of Waze, a few new unicorns, and dozens of venture-backed startups by YC, GC, A16Z, Softbank, etc.
• Keep 100% of what you make: we are here to empower independent builders, and that’s why A.Team charges a percentage on top of your rate.
• Do more with a team you like: our focus is on small, diverse, cross-functional teams of insanely talented developers, PMs, designers, growth leads, etc. This is because clients with bigger budgets & more ambitious work need teams to solve problems, not individuals to do tasks. That said, we try to keep friends together, since clients love builders who have worked together before.
• Full autonomy: we only want you to join teams when the timing's right. Often they start around 15-20hrs/week, and last at least 3-6 months (longer if it's going great, or contract-to-hire if true love appears).
• Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations you wouldn't have elsewhere & connecting with other top-tier builders who you may like to collaborate with.

How to apply:

Go here: https://build.a.team/builtinnyc + mention Built in NYC under "how did you hear about A·Team?" (we're HQ'd in NYC)

No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if this seems like a fit.

What you’ll do:
• Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would
• Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.
• You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.

Who A.Team is for:
• Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy
• Those not looking for a full-time role, but who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders
• The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) or bootstrapping a side hustle, or looking for their next big thing

Who A.Team is not for:
• People looking for small gigs
• Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites
• Recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)

Our long-term vision:

Obviously this isn’t a standard job post for a standard job; A.Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams.

To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely

title : Software Engineer, Developer Infrastructure
company_name : The Browser Company
location :  Anywhere 
via : via Jobs
description : Hi, we're The Browser Company 👋 and we're building a better way to use the internet.

Browsers are unique in that they are one of the only pieces of software that you share with your parents as well as your kids. Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things — through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their... own, they don’t actually do a whole lot, they’re kind of just there. They don’t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more — it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That’s why we’re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.

To accomplish this lofty task, we’re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn’t optional, it’s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens.

With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.

About The Role

As a Developer Infrastructure Engineer at The Browser Company, you will create tools, systems, and scripts that empower our teams to ship features to members quickly and safely. You’ll build software that answers questions like–
• How do we get the Swift developer environment on Windows to rival that of C# on Windows or Swift on Mac?
• How do we improve our build times, and make our builds more stable?
• How do we improve the Swift debugging experience in VSCode?
• How do we improve our UI testing framework’s reliability and reduce flakiness?
• How do we push the cross-platform Swift ecosystem forward, with new libraries, blogposts, or compiler improvements?

Overall you will...
• Scope and spearhead technical projects across our Windows and Mac developer experience, including within our toolchain, builds, developer tooling, and app architecture.
• Design APIs and tools that abstract away complexity and allow product engineers to iterate quickly, collaborating closely with other engineers across the company.
• Ensure product development is progressing quickly by finding and fixing inefficiencies in the appropriate layer of the system.
• Dig into various layers of our development stack, including our compiler, dependencies, editor, language server, and build system, to improve performance and ergonomics.
• Give back to the open source community. We believe in upstreaming our work to benefit the community that we benefit greatly from.

After 1 month you will...
• Onboard onto our team and codebase with your onboarding buddy
• Attend a number of onboarding presentations on the company, product, codebase, and culture
• Get familiar with Swift, our Swift toolchain and tooling, and our Windows and Mac roadmap
• Ship a few bug fixes and small improvements across our codebase and tooling
• Have pair programmed with a few people on the engineering team
• Be regularly posting product feedback about the browser in our #dogfooding channel

After 3 months you will...
• Be familiar with our Windows and Mac dev environment, and be thinking of ways to make product engineers' lives easier when prototyping and building new developer tooling
• Be familiar with our Swift toolchain, our Swift for Windows bindings, and how we integrate with Chromium
• Shipped a few tickets to improve developer tools like our Swift toolchain, editor experience, debugger, or builds
• Be involved in weekly engineering discussions about our architecture, how we do code review, code style, and more.
• Be involved in infrastructure discussions like how we add better observability to debug issues in production, how we better monitor performance regressions, and how we make our updater less finicky.

After 6 months you will...
• Be driving projects from conception to production launch.
• Be interview trained and interviewing candidates for roles at the Browser Company.
• Be mentoring and pair programming with newer engineers to help them get spun up on the codebase.

Qualifications
• You have experience with OS-level tools and build environments, open-source developer tooling, or general low-level systems experience. Bonus points if you’re familiar with OS-specific performance profiling tools, WinDBG and LLDB, language server protocol implementations, or VSCode extensions.
• You’re familiar with multiple build systems such as CMake, Bazel, Buck, or MSBuild
• You’re well-versed in C++, and have used it in a professional setting
• You're passionate about building tools and systems that make other engineers more productive.
• You have experience tech leading critical projects or initiatives within your team and organization.
• You've worked on large, complex codebases.
• You understand how to improve systems to make them easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
• You're excited about elegant, maintainable, and easy to use build tooling and configuration.
• You're pragmatic and can see the bigger picture; you're able to reason about prioritization and scope.
• You bias to action. We like learning as quickly as possible, so we embrace failing fast to refine our code, systems, and processes rapidly.

Compensation and Benefits

With our flexible compensation model, employees have the ability to design their compensation according to their needs. People join startups for different reasons and we want to be accommodating and flexible to everyone’s lives. Every candidate approved for an offer receives two options:

✉️ The first offer is a lower salary with a higher equity package

✉️ The second is a higher salary with a lower equity package.

Candidates can choose either option or anywhere in between the two on a sliding scale. The annual salary range for this role is $150,000-$300,000 USD, and the actual salary range offered will vary based on experience level and interview performance.

The Browser Company is a well funded, ambitious startup of about 70 people (and growing!) who are passionate about building great products.
