description : Who are we:

At Thanx, our goal is to empower restaurant chains nationwide with unparalleled digital guest engagement, loyalty, and marketing solutions.

As we continue to scale and expand our reach, we're actively seeking passionate developers to join our dynamic team and contribute to our innovative journey. This role offers the opportunity to work on exciting projects, collaborate with experienced professionals, and contribute to the development of robust software solutions.

This is a remote position.

What You’ll Do:
• Architect and Develop Robust Software Solutions: Build well crafted, scalable, maintainable, and resilient software across the entire stack
• Enhance Software Stability and Resilience: Diagnose and address bugs while tackling root causes to bolster the stability and resilience of our software, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Who You Are:
• 3+ years experience as a developer working with modern web frameworks, such as RoR, Django, or similar.
• You’ve worked with modern front-end technologies, such as React, Angular, Typescript or similar.
• You’re excited to work on full-stack problems, even though your interests may lean heavily towards one part of the stack over others
• You’re able to work effectively as part of a geographically distributed team in an agile development environment

Bonus Points:
• Direct experience with Ruby on Rails, React & React Native
• B.Sc or higher in Computer Science

More About Thanx:

Thanx is a leading provider of digital guest engagement for offline businesses. Brick-and-mortar retailers, restaurants, and malls are facing an unprecedented crisis in the aftermath of COVID-19; Thanx helps these businesses embrace digital purchasing, capture greater customer data, and take action on that information to personalize every interaction with their guests. Our proprietary integrations with credit card networks (e.g. Visa) provide the volume and accuracy of purchase data which sits at the core of every product we build. Last quarter, Thanx saw record digital purchasing and marketing campaigns initiated on our platform, even amid a global pandemic. Recently named to the Nation’s Restaurant News “2020 Power List” as one of the 50 most influential innovators in food-service, our CEO describes our vision: “Brick-and-mortar commerce in the US alone is a multi-trillion dollar category but most businesses still severely lack the data and tools to deliver personalized, closed-loop marketing. Thanx is on a mission to change this permanently.”

Thanx has gained the investment of prominent venture and growth equity luminaries, having raised more than $30M from elite investors such as M33 Growth, Ribbit Capital, and Sequoia Capital. Core to our success is a culture that has attracted some of the best talents from across the country; we are proud of our incredibly strong employee tenure, track-record of internal promotions, and impressive alumni network. We credit our cultural “core behaviors” with these accomplishments: Find A Way, Focus on What Matters, Say “Thanx” Genuinely, Welcome Diverse Perspectives, and Empathy Over Ego.

Some technology we use:
• Frontend: React, React Native, Redux, Typescript
• Backend: Ruby on Rails, Golang, gRPC
• Infrastructure: AWS, Fargate, Terraform, Docker
• Data: Fivetran, Snowflake, dbt, Looker
• Development: CircleCI, Github, Datadog, Sentry

title : Software Engineer II, Developer Platform, Identity and Access...
company_name : Included Health
location :  Anywhere 
via : via Built In
description : Role Summary:

The Developer Platform team is nimble, innovative, and rapidly growing as it creates the foundational building blocks leveraged by every data scientist and software engineer at Included Health. We understand and anticipate the needs of developers working in a service oriented architecture, which allows us to maximize our impact with cross-cutting features. The Developer Platform... team comprises two focus areas: Developer Experience and Identity and Access Management (IAM). Currently, these two groups are focused on simplifying operation/rapid creation of microservices and rebuilding our IAM platform respectively.

The Developer Platform team is part of the greater Infrastructure organization with a shared mission to drive engineering velocity. Infrastructure engineers are impactful, high-leverage force-multipliers; we thrive by causally improving the effectiveness of the entire engineering organization. We work directly with our stakeholders, exercising the right amount of empathy to help define and scope our projects. If you believe that self-organizing, highly autonomous teams build better platforms, then this is the right opportunity for you. We are not an operations team.

We are agile and iterative in nature and consistently optimize for impact. We recognize that we may not get technology, tooling, or processes right on our first try and thus believe shipping value incrementally and learning is the best way to maximize our impact. We are looking for smart, self-motivated software engineers at all levels to join our truly exceptional development team.

Responsibilities:
• Create infrastructure software and high leverage tools, libraries, and frameworks in Go.
• Own and contribute to the construction and continuous improvement of a robust IAM platform.
• Collaborate on ambitious technical projects that address issues with high ambiguity.
• Interface with a wide variety of teams to evangelize technologies we create.
• Build cross-cutting features in the dataplane by using and extending state of the art service mesh technologies.

Required Qualifications:
• You get a rush when you improve the productivity of and remove barriers from fellow engineers.
• You have sound software engineering fundamentals and are able to apply them when faced with an ambiguous problem space.
• You care about software and are proud of what you deliver.
• You optimize for impact over progress and love getting stuff done (GSD).
• You have the ability to interface with multidisciplinary teams across the organization.

Preferred Qualifications:
• Experience with Go
• Understanding of modern IAM standards and protocols.
• Experience working in a service oriented architecture.
