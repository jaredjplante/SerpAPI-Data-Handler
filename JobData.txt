After talking with hundreds of independent builders, we get that finding vetted, high-quality clients is hard and tasks are often too small to be rewarding; A·Teams are formed for impactful new products with companies backed by A16Z, GC, Softbank... Apollo, YC, etc. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $7.3+ million since then.\n\nAs part of A·Team, you can expect:\n• High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. A·Team is picky, and only works with companies referred to us by top funds or existing members and clients such as Lyft, McGraw Hill, the former-CEO of Waze, a few new unicorns, and dozens of venture-backed startups by YC, GC, A16Z, Softbank, etc.\n• Keep 100% of what you make: we are here to empower independent builders, and that’s why A.Team charges a percentage on top of your rate.\n• Do more with a team you like: our focus is on small, diverse, cross-functional teams of insanely talented developers, PMs, designers, growth leads, etc. This is because clients with bigger budgets & more ambitious work need teams to solve problems, not individuals to do tasks. That said, we try to keep friends together, since clients love builders who have worked together before.\n• Full autonomy: we only want you to join teams when the timing\'s right. Often they start around 15-20hrs/week, and last at least 3-6 months (longer if it\'s going great, or contract-to-hire if true love appears).\n• Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations you wouldn\'t have elsewhere & connecting with other top-tier builders who you may like to collaborate with.\n\nHow to apply:\n\nGo here: https://build.a.team/builtinnyc + mention Built in NYC under "how did you hear about A·Team?" (we\'re HQ\'d in NYC)\n\nNo resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We\'re also much more interested in seeing what you\'ve made, and excited to chat more if this seems like a fit.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n• Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would\n• Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.\n• You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.\n\nWho A.Team is for:\n• Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy\n• Those not looking for a full-time role, but who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders\n• The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work) or bootstrapping a side hustle, or looking for their next big thing\n\nWho A.Team is not for:\n• People looking for small gigs\n• Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites\n• Recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)\n\nOur long-term vision:\n\nObviously this isn’t a standard job post for a standard job; A.Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them "unhirables": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams.\n\nTo help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple\'s Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton\'s Adam Grant, and Duke\'s Dan Ariely', 'job_highlights': [{'title': 'Qualifications', 'items': ['Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites', 'Recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)']}, {'title': 'Responsibilities', 'items': ['Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline', 'Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team', 'You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution']}, {'title': 'Benefits', 'items': ['Keep 100% of what you make: we are here to empower independent builders, and that’s why A.Team charges a percentage on top of your rate']}], 'related_links': [{'link': 'https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a5d739ec3717dc50&gl=us&hl=en&q=A.Team&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV4L-ChYSEAxXVxuYEHb6yBZI4KBCYkAIIuAs', 'text': 'See web results for A.Team'}], 'thumbnail': 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1pIGHKJUv4n_HVjXuYKWWXKN3Cgc1piGUg7rYE_zsR8warWEv80bYtfg&s', 'extensions': ['Full-time and Contractor', 'No degree mentioned'], 'detected_extensions': {'schedule_type': 'Full-time and Contractor'}, 'job_id': 'eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJTZW5pb3IgU29mdHdhcmUgRGV2ZWxvcGVyIChDb250cmFjdCwgJDExMC0kMTkwL2hyKSB0ZWFtaW5nIHVwIGZvciB0aGUgd29ybGTigJlzIG1vc3QgaW1wYWN0ZnVsIG1pc3Npb25zIChSZW1vdGUpIiwiaHRpZG9jaWQiOiJCVUt1NkNZX3A0N0RoYWl3QUFBQUFBPT0iLCJ1dWxlIjoidytDQUlRSUNJTlZXNXBkR1ZrSUZOMFlYUmxjdyIsImdsIjoidXMiLCJobCI6ImVuIiwiZmMiOiJFb3dEQ3N3Q1FVNTFWMmhqYmxGaE4xWktWM1JQUnpabU9GOVZaRkpXY3kxVWRHdGhhVFV6TFU4NE5FdElaVGxFUlZWQ1ZFbHpUbGRtT0UwMlNVdHBjMFZ5VTFWQlQyeEJWMnRRVFhnMVFUaDFVRVJRVGpWWU1VSmtXRWhrWHpkVFJWZ3pRbFpzUkhBM2R6VmhaMFUxY2xwc1NraFJRblZhZEV4eU5GSm5lbEJRVjNobFQxQndVbVJPY200dGIyeDJjRlZMYlhabmVGOVVhVTFFY0hGVlJXcFhkVnBYTUdaVGFtb3dla2RHUjNwQlZ6YzVRelpWY1ZvMWR6TkVXbTQzT1hGUk0yTXdkVmhWVWw5WWIxaHRWbHBFUjA1S1UyWXpUM2M1WW1aM2JWVktjMVUxVkRoNlZrOUdNVk5vY21KVmIyTktOWEZ1Y25WblJHbFhhR1F4WlhKNExUaEtMVFEzYkd0R1JXeEtkbTVtWHpKM04xRlljRjlGUmxadGRrMUJSR2x1UkdkUVJtMHlkMU51U0UxMVpHMVdTRkJRVW5aTFEyOUZUMlF4T0dab1pYWlRNM2g1VjFsVWFYWlBWVVJJZGxFU0YxbEdkVFJhWkZkM1MyUlhUbTA1WTFCMmRWZFhhMEZyR2lKQlVGaG9iVFZaU0dKNWRtZFRlamRyVUhGdmIzUm1VMmRyYTBGNGIwcDJNRXBuIiwiZmN2IjoiMyIsImZjX2lkIjoiZmNfNyIsImFwcGx5X2xpbmsiOnsidGl0bGUiOiJBcHBseSBvbiBCdWlsdCBJbiBOWUMiLCJsaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVpbHRpbm55Yy5jb20vam9iL3Nlbmlvci1zb2Z0d2FyZS1kZXZlbG9wZXItY29udHJhY3QtMTEwLTE5MGhyLXRlYW1pbmctd29ybGRzLW1vc3QtaW1wYWN0ZnVsLW1pc3Npb25zLzEwOTM5MT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249Z29vZ2xlX2pvYnNfYXBwbHlcdTAwMjZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvb2dsZV9qb2JzX2FwcGx5XHUwMDI2dXRtX21lZGl1bT1vcmdhbmljIn19'}, {'title': 'Software Engineer, Site Reliability', 'company_name': 'SupplyPike', 'location': '  Rogers, AR   ', 'via': 'via SupplyPike Careers', 'description': "Software Engineer, Site Reliability\n\nDepartment: Engineering...\n\nEmployment Type: Full Time\n\nLocation: Rogers.
